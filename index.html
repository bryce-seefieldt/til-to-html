		<h1>This is the title.</h1>
		<p>A TIL—Today I Learned—is the most liberating form of content I know of.</p>
		<p>Did you just learn how to do something? <b>Write about that.</b></p>
		<p>Call it a TIL—that way you’re not promising <i>anyone</i> a <i>revelation</i> or an in-depth tutorial. You’re saying “I <b>just figured this out</b>: here are my notes, you may find them <b>useful</b> too”.</p>
		<p>I also like the humility of this kind of content. Part of the reason I publish them is to emphasize that even with 25 years of professional experience you should still celebrate learning even the most basic of things.</p>
		<p>I learned the “interact” command in pdb the other day! <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pdb-interact">Here’s my TIL</a>.</p>
		<p>I started publishing TILs <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">in April 2020</a>. I’m up to 346 now, and most of them took less than 10 minutes to write. It’s such a great format for quick and satisfying online writing.</p>
		<p>My collection lives at https://til.simonwillison.net/—which publishes content from my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til">simonw/til</a> GitHub repository.</p>
