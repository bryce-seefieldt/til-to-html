A TIL—Today I Learned—is the most liberating form of content I know of.

Did you just learn how to do something? **Write about that.**

Call it a TIL—that way you’re not promising *anyone* a _revelation_ or an in-depth tutorial. You’re saying “I **just figured this out**: here are my notes, you may find them **useful** too”.

I also like the humility of this kind of content. Part of the reason I publish them is to emphasize that even with 25 years of professional experience you should still celebrate learning even the most basic of things.

I learned the “interact” command in pdb the other day! [Here’s my TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pdb-interact).

I started publishing TILs [in April 2020](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/). I’m up to 346 now, and most of them took less than 10 minutes to write. It’s such a great format for quick and satisfying online writing.

My collection lives at https://til.simonwillison.net/—which publishes content from my [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til) GitHub repository.
